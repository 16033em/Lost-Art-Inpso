       It is important to learn to draw well before you try to develop your ability in other areas of art.
             In other words, drawing is the best way to kick start your skills. The best way to begin your 
             drawing career is simply by drawing everything. You want to draw as many different things as you 
             can as this helps grow your understanding of how you can represent what you see. There is truly 
             no better way to improve than practise. You donâ€™t have to spend a long time on your drawing; the
             main purpose of drawing is to help you grow your ability to accurately see and then transfer this 
             information to paper.
            <br>
      My advice to you when beginning to draw, is to start by drawing everyday objects. You could try to do a blind 
             contour drawing, which is when you set an object in front of you and then draw that object without looking
             at your paper. The secret to this type of drawing is to not take your eyes off the object, to constantly study
             the object while you are drawing it and not take your pen/pencil off of the paper. Maybe try to draw your own 
             hand this way. This technique helps you develop the skill of having your eyes and your hand work together 
             simultaneously. 
            <br>
      Something to understand as an artist at any level, is that you must also practice patience and acceptance of your 
             developing drawing skills. You must focus on not getting frustrated by the outcome of your first drawings. 
             Also, have patience with drawings that seem to be coming out badly again and again. Do not give up simply 
             because they do not look like you want them to.

    Horizon lines are important to master if you want to create accurate images, in drawing and in all artworks.
            You need to understand where they should be placed on the page and how objects in the composition relate
            to them. The most important tip I can give you in regards to scenic drawings, is that all horizontal lines 
            should connect to one specific point on the horizon line.
          <br>
    The horizon line is often thought to be exactly in the middle of the page, when in reality it depends where you
            are looking at the view from. If you are looking down on your view, the horizon line is likely to be higher
            on the page, leaving more space for the ground. If you are looking at the view from a lower perspective, you 
            would have the horizon line at a lower point on the page, leaving more space for the sky. It is troublesome 
            to understand at first, but once you get the hang of it, it comes very naturally. The best way to practice 
            this skill is by finding a different view everyday and drawing it, always starting with the horizon line.

     Painting is about using the skills you learnt from drawing with different materials and implements. 
           You will need to develop an understanding of how the different mediums can be manipulated. You 
           will use the understanding you learned in your drawing practice, but it will need to be applied 
           in a new way. To introduce yourself to painting, simply draw a picture and then paint over it, 
           in the same way that you would color in a coloring book. This will help you get an understanding 
           of how to manipulate your painting medium. Make sure that while you are doing this, you are trying 
           lots of different techniques. For example, painting purely with flat unmixed color, and staying away 
           from tonal work, or going completely black and white and avoiding color, working to represent your 
           objects only with tone
           <br>
     Try out lots of different equipment when painting. I usually use two differently shaped paint brushes for a
           single painting (eg, 1 medium square brush, 1 small pointed brush). The types of brushes you use will 
           depend on how you want to paint. I also like to use a paint palette, which is just a hard surface which
           is used solely for laying out and mixing your paint. Sometimes I enjoy using a palette knife, which is 
           a new way of bringing texture to your painting. There are many ways to use palette knives; just go and
           watch some of Bob Rossâ€™s videos to see some examples. 
          <br>
     A helpful tip for blending paint on your work is dry brushing. To do this, you have two colors that you wish to
           blend. You take a completely dry and clean brush and then gently drag the two wet colors into each other,
           remembering to regularly wipe the paint off the brush.

      Acrylic Paint: When starting out with paint, you really should know that there are different types of paint that 
             can be used for different things. I would advise using Acrylic paint to start with. It  is not only cheaper
             than other types of paint, it is also a good way to start to understand how paint works, as it is an easily 
             applicable material. Acrylic is a very smooth medium, and doesnâ€™t hold texture, making it very easy to apply.
             Some issues with using acrylic is that it dries very quickly, and depending on the quality of the paint you 
             buy, it can dry dull and be lacking in pigment.
            <br> <br>
     Oil paint: Oil Paint is a well loved and traditional painting medium. It was used by the old masters, such as Leonardo 
             Da Vinci, Rembrandt and Vincent Van Gogh. This type of paint dries incredibly slowly, meaning it is a lot more 
             movable and blendable, but it takes a lot of practise to understand and use. In texture it is stiffer and 
             therefore more textured than acrylic paint. Oil paint may not be the best medium for beginners, but if you want 
             to experiment with it, there are many Youtube tutorials which will give you tips, so you can have a little fun. 
            <br> <br>
    Mixing color in painting: Color mixing with your paint is another skill you will need to learn and practice. Color mixing
             is an important skill to develop as it is where you find and create colors that are just right for your purpose.
             When you have mastered this, you will be able to create exact matches of colors you see before you, quickly and 
             without wasting your paint. To do this you will need to understand the color spectrum, and then you will need to
             start practicing ways you can mix the colours you have. To do this, just find a color in a book, on a wall, on a 
             painting and try to recreate it. (Be sure to use the paint afterwards!). A helpful tip I learned from one of my 
             teachers is when mixing paint to create depth in a piece, you need to experiment with tones. For example, when 
             giving your object depth, you should not simply create a darker version of the color of the object. Instead, mix 
             a duller and grayer version of the original color you created. This means you will need to add more black to your
             color. In creating tonal variation in painting an object, often you will do this until the color looks almost 
             entirely black.

    Mixing different art mediums and materials is one of the many fun ways that artists can explore textures. There
            are many different things that you could combine to create new textures and looks that will be 
            interesting to a viewer. For example, in the images on this website you will see that there are 
            many different textures and looks to each piece. The bottom image is created using collage - this
            means it has been created by adding parts of other images in layers which has given it quite a distorted 
            look. You can see many different shapes and textures. The materials used on this piece are; wallpaper, 
            paper, acaldo blocks, paint and charcoal. They are all put together in a particular way to make sure that 
            the image is balanced, and that the gaze of the viewer is led through the whole work. This particular piece 
            is also designed to be visually confusing to the eye, because it is difficult to discern certain objects 
            and shapes from one another. This example is quite an abstract piece, but mixed materials do not have to 
            always be abstract. You can try and make realistic pieces using cuttings from magazines and old drawings and 
            paintings you have made. It's really about how far your imagination can stretch.

   An exciting thing about working with mixed materials and mediums is that it is an ideal platform for artistic exploration. 
           You can try out new mediums for the first time, or maybe just find out if charcoal and watered down paints work well
           together. For example, perhaps you have a particular message or idea that you want to explore and show visually, and 
           you discover that using two materials that wouldnâ€™t normally be used together is the ideal way to communicate it. 
           <br>
  I strongly believe the most important thing in working and exploring in this style is imagination. Mixed materials is 
           not an art style that has rules or needs tips or tricks, as it can be all about an artist expressing their 
           creative strengths, interests and ideas. So the best advice I can give you here is to have as much fun as is
           humanly possible!

     Watercolor paint is a very popular painting medium. It can be used to create backgrounds, as well as detailed 
              little objects in the foreground. You can create varied works using only watercolor, and also mix it 
              with many other mediums. Watercolor can be used to make complicated pieces of art as well as simple pieces.
              <br>
    One of the most important things to understand when using this medium is to use the white of the paper to create 
              your highlights. This means where you would normally block in darker areas of your work and then add 
              in your highlighted areas afterwards, when using acrylic or oils. How you would use watercolor to do this,
              you would leave your highlighted areas unpainted and build the color of the darker areas while still leaving
              the lighter areas white. This can make water color quite a difficult skill to master, and you will often need
              to use large quantities of color to get the desired effect you are chasing after. Also, it can take some time
              to master blending edges into the white/highlights of your paper without discoloring the pure white.
             <br>
    Another issue with watercolor is that it is a transparent medium. When you want to create specific colours for your
              piece you need to build up multiple layers of color to get the desired shade or density of pigment. This 
              is because water color is such a light medium. It can create incredibly intense images and also very soft 
              images, in a way that other mediums cannot replicate. However a possible downside to using watercolor as a
              beginner, is that once you apply it,  itâ€™s almost impossible to remove or make lighter. The white paint in
              watercolor doesnâ€™t really work as a color softener. It is most useful to change the intensity of your base 
              pigment - i.e. making red pink or deep blue much paler. I recommend experimenting with this on scrap pieces 
              of paper until you are confident with it.

     Another skill to master when beginning to use watercolor is how to make the naturally flowing water mixed with paint stay in the areas
            you want it in, and not move into areas around it. This is another thing that will become easier with practice. It can be a slow 
            process, and you can find great tips for controlling your paint on the internet. 
            <br>
      You can get different textured backgrounds and effects using watercolor. For example, by wetting the entire piece of paper you are about
            to work on, then adding your paint, which will then create fun expanding circles of color. You can also wet certain areas of a page
            to restrict the expansion, or you can simply put the paint straight on to dry paper. When you begin to understand the way that you
            can move your arm, page or brush to create a desired shape you will be able to explore new ways to use watercolor.

     Oil Pastels are a lot of fun to use, especially if you enjoy working with messy mediums. However they are not always used 
            in a messy way. It is possible to use them in quite clean and precise ways. The most common way to use oil pastels 
            is to mash them into the page so they become almost paste-like. This makes them easier to blend, spread, and cover 
            the required area in a thick and pigmented way. 
            <br>
      There are many ways to use oil pastels. In the image of the orange skull to the right, you see the results of using a 
            chemical solvent that melted the oil pastels down and assisted them to blend. This also helps keep the color fixed
            to the page as it is less likely to rub off  or fade with time.

     A big advantage of oil pastels is that colors mix easily together. This means that your work can be more colorful
             and abstract than when using other mediums. You donâ€™t have to practise as much to figure out how to use 
             this medium. You can generally get the hang of it fairly easily.  It is like combining the techniques of 
             coloring with pencils, and blending with paint. As long as you understand the basic principles of art you 
             should be able to easily use oil pastels.
            <br>
    To use them at a more advanced level, you can use them as an alternative to paint. Oil pastels can also create an 
             entirely different texture from paint. Acrylic paints create flat color (which can be blended and layered 
             to add more texture) and oil pastels when used in a certain way and blended out entirely, can also give you 
             incredibly flat color. However if you wanted to bring in different textures, you can scratch or roughen the 
             surface of the pastel on the page very easily. You can also add texture by not blending the colors too neatly, 
             or pressing down heavily while applying to the page, which creates strong color. There are many ways to use oil 
             pastels and the best way to figure out how you want to use them is by playing around with them on scrap paper, 
             trying as many different techniques as you can to find the one that you like best.

    Art is something that many people think about starting as a hobby. They think that it would be really satisfying to
             be able to create images that are exact copies of things you see every day, or images of ideas that you wish 
             to materialize using your own hands. However, many of us begin the learning process and realise it's not
             something that naturally happens. Art skills are things that are worked on and worked on for many years, 
             until the artist finally reaches a skill level that they are happy with. Be patient.
            <br> <br>
    Some more tips for beginners: Another important concept to learn about and master before you begin is composition. 
             I struggled with this at first and discovered It is a crucial skill that can make or break your artwork. 
             Composition is about how your artwork is put together.This can include anything from the color of each part 
             of the piece, the number of objects and how they are arranged on your page or canvas, and the texture and 
             detail of parts or of the whole work. The purpose of composition is to attract the viewer's eye and guide it 
             naturally to flow along a suggested path through your piece. If the composition is a jumble with no real
             direction for the eye to follow, it will either confuse the viewer, or fail to catch their eye. Giving them 
             a path to follow will help them find their way through the whole piece and more easily understand it.

     I would reiterate that if you are just beginning on your art journey, you develop your drawing skills first. This is because
            the skills you develop when drawing are ones that are applicable to all artistic mediums. For example, your ability to
            take in visual information and then represent it on a piece of paper or canvas. As you practice you will begin to 
            understand how to use your tools to convey what you are seeing in the most accurate way. When you begin to understand
            the small mechanics you will find drawing from sight a lot easier, and you will be able to draw faster and more accurately. 
            As drawing becomes easier, you will be able to take these skills into your paintings and other works.  
            <br> <br>
      Finally, know that reading tips and instructions will not ultimately make you any better at creating art. The only thing that
            will do that is practice and experimentation. You may find inspiration in the words and works of others, but it is the 
            doing that will build your skills and help you deliver your own message. How this happens for you will be a process you 
            figure out for yourself. This is why creating art is a very personal process, because only you can develop at your own 
            pace. You will find some things easy to learn, and others hard, but if they matter, you will practice until you are 
            confident at them. Be persistent and patient with yourself and your work. Even when you are feeling frustrated and 
            like your work is no good you must power through that and continue to find ways to develop. There is nothing wrong 
            with realising you are good at and enjoying one medium or style and focusing on developing that. As long as you enjoy 
            creating, that is all that matters. It may not be as good as you would like it to be, but it is yours and it marks a
            time in your art  and your life journey that is important in itâ€™s own right.
