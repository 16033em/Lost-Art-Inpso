       Drawing is the most important thing to understand before you try to develop your ability in other areas of art. In other words,
             drawing is the best way to kick start your skills. Now, the best way to start your drawing career is by simply drawing 
             everything. You want to draw as many different things as you can. Doing this helps grow your understanding behind the 
             mechanics of how things look and how you can show that on paper. There is truly no other way to improve other than practise.
             You don’t have to spend a long time on your drawing, the main purpose of the drawing is to help you grow an understanding on
             viewing and then regurgitating the information you are viewing from looking at the object.
             <br>
       My advice to you when beginning to draw start by drawing objects. Try to do a blind contour drawing. is by setting an object in front 
             of you and then drawing that said object without looking at you drawing. You should not take your eyes off the object. 
             You should be constantly studying the object while you are drawing it. You should also not take your pen/pencil off of 
             the paper. A good object to use while doing this practise, is your hand.  This practice technique helps you develop the 
             skill to have your eyes and your hand work together simultaneously.  How you perform a blind drawingNow something to make 
             clear is that you must come to terms with your art skill, you must focus on not getting frustrated by the outcome of your 
             first drawings, do not give up simply because they do not look like you want them to.

     A technique that is important to understand before you start your art career in drawing or simply in general.
            You really must try to understand horizon lines. You need to understand where they need to be placed 
            on the page and how objects in the picture relate to it. The most important tip I can give you in regards
            to scenic drawings of places. Is that all horizontal lines connect to one specific point on the horizon line.
      <br>
    The horizon line is often thought to be directly in the middle page, when in reality it depends where you are looking 
            at the piece from. If you are looking down on your view, the horizon line is likely to be higher on the page, 
            leaving more space for the ground. If you were looking at the view from a lower perspective you would have the 
            horizon line at a lower point on the page, leaving more space for the sky. It is troublesome to understand at 
            first but once you get the hang of it comes very naturally. The best way to practice this skill is by finding 
            a view everyday and then drawing it, but always starting by drawing the horizon line.

     Painting is where you carry the skills you learnt from drawing in to a new material situation.
           You need to create a new understanding of how the material can be manipulated. Since you 
           started by learning how to draw the technique and understanding will be there but will just
           need to be applied in a new way. A way to introduce yourself to painting is by simply drawing 
           a picture and the painting over that drawing, like coloring in a coloring book. This will help
           you get the understanding on how to manipulate the material. Make sure while you are doing this 
           you are trying lots of different techniques to do so. This could be painting purely with colorful
           paints and staying away from tonal work, or going completely black and white with zero color and
           working purely with tone.
           <br>
     Also try out lots of different equipment when painting. The equipment I will usually use on one painting 
           is: 2 Paint brushes (1 medium square brush, 1 small pointed brush), the type of brush will depend on
           the painting. A paint palette, this is just a hard surface that is used solely for your paint. You 
           will mix your paint here and also hold your separate colors here. Sometimes if I feel like it I will 
           use a palette knife. There are loads of ways to use palette knives, just go and watch some of Bob Ross’s 
           videos and you will see that you can not only mix your paint using them but you can also use them to 
           create new types of textures and shapes on your painting. Then I will of course use all sorts of colors
           of paint.
           <br>
   A little tip for blending paint on your work is dry brushing. This is when you have two colors that you wish to blend, 
           you will take a completely dry and clean brush and then gently drag the two wet colors into each other, remembering 
           to regularly wipe the paint on the brush off.

       When starting out with paint you really should know that there are different types of paint that can be used for different 
             things. I would advise using Acrylic paint to start out with. It  is not only a lot cheaper than other types of paint
             it is also a good way to start to understand how paint works, as it is a very applicable material. Acrylic is a lot 
             smoother and less textured, it's very easy to apply. Its difficulty is that it dries very quickly and depending on 
             the quality of the paint you buy it can be very lacking in pigment.
             <br>
       Oil paint is the more commonly well known style of paint. It was used by the old masters, such as Leonardo Da Vinci, Rembrandt 
             and Vincent Van Gogh. This type of paint dries incredibly slowly meaning it is a lot more movable and blendable but it 
             takes a lot of practise to understand and use. Oil paint is a lot more stiff and therefore more textured than acrylic paint.
             I myself have never used oil paint but I have gained a small understanding from talking with more experienced artists around 
             me. I do understand however, oil paint is not for beginners unless of course you just want to use it for fun. 
            <br>
      Mixing paint is also a skill you will need to practice well. Paint mixing is a must when beginning to paint, it is where you find and
             create colors that are just right for your purpose. When you practise enough you will be able to create exact matches of colors
             you see before you on the first try. To do this you will need to understand the color spectrum, and how mixing colors can make
             other colors and then you will need to start practicing yourself. Just find a color in a book, on a wall, on a painting and try
             mixing that color (Be sure to use the paint afterwards!).
             <br>
     The best tip that I recently came to understand is when mixing paint to create depth in a piece you need to experiment with tones. Creating 
             tones is not creating a darker version of the color you are trying to make a shadow on, it is about making a dull and grayer version
             of the color you created. This means you need to add more black to your color. Often you will do this until the color is pretty much black.

      Mixing Materials is one of the many fun ways that artists can explore textures. There are loads of different 
            things that people can combine to create new textures and looks that are very fascinating to a viewer. 
            In the images provided you can see that there is a different look to each piece. The bottom image you
            can likely see is a collage style image. It is quite a distorted style. In the image you can see many 
            different shapes that you can recognise from other images in references. The materials used on this piece
            are; wallpaper, paper, acaldo blocks, paint and charcoal. 
            <br>
            They are all put together in a particular way
            that makes sure that the image is balanced. Meaning that all the areas of the piece evenly guide the gaze 
            of the viewer through the work. This particular piece is designed in a quite confusing way, meaning that 
            it is difficult to dersiern certain things from one another. This is quite an abstract piece, but mixed 
            materials do not have to always be abstract, you can try and make realistic pieces using cuttings from a 
            magazine. It's really about how far your imagination can stretch.

     The main thing to understand about mixed materials is that it is, in a way, purely an artist exploring. You can try out new mediums 
           for the first time, or you maybe just wanted to see if charcoal and watered down paints worked well together. Or maybe you had 
           a particular message that you wanted to get across and thought that using two materials that wouldn’t normally be used together
           would be the best way to get it across. 
           <br>
    The most important thing to explore this style is purely imagination. Mixed materials is not an art style that needs tips or tricks 
           really as it is purely an artist expressing their wants, interests and messages. So the best advice to you for doing this, 
           is to have as much fun as humanly possible.

          Water Colors Basics

      Water color is often used more often than you would think. It is used very often to create backgrounds, as well as detailed
              little objects in the foreground. It can also be the sole material used in a piece. Watercolor can be used to make 
              complicated pieces of art as well as simple pieces. When water coloring, the most important thing to understand is 
              to use the white from the paper. The white from the paper stands as your highlight, so when you would normally start
              with the darker areas you must start with light areas and build up. This is why it is often quite a difficult skill 
              to master as you will likely need to use large quantities of your color to get the desired effect that you are chasing 
              after and you will likely struggle to blend into the white of the paper with discoloring the pure white. 
              <br>
      The issue with watercolor, is that since it is a building medium, meaning when you want to color something on the piece you need 
              to use multiple layers of the color or another color to get the desired pigment. This is because water color is such a 
              light medium, it can create incredibly intense images and soft images at the same time, in a way that no other medium 
              can replicate. But the issue again with this is that once you apply the water color it is almost impossible to remove or 
              make lighter. White in water color doesn’t quite work as a color softener, it works more to change the pigment. This is a 
              skill you can practice on scrap pieces of paper.

     The thing that most artists struggle with when beginning with watercolor is how to make the naturally flowing water
            stay in specific areas unlike the others around it. This is something that again will come naturally to you.
            It is a slow process but it will come along with your drawing techniques. Some ways to get different textures
            from watercolor, it by wetting the entire piece of paper you are about to work on, this creates fun expanding 
            colors. You can also just wet certain areas of a piece that you want to watercolor or you can simply put the
            material straight on to the paper. 
            <br>
    When you begin to understand the way that you can move your arm to create the desired shape that you are observing you will 
            be able to slowly develop your own understanding on how to create that shape using different materials.

     This material is a lot of fun to use if you enjoy quite messy mediums. But they are not always needed to 
            be used in a messy way. It is possible to use them in such a way that means that they are quite clean 
            and precise. The best way to use oil pastels is to generally mash them into the page so they become 
            almost paste-like meaning that they are lost easier to blend, spread, but also cover the set area in
            a thick and pigmented way. This means that they will cover the area and then blend a lot easier and stronger.
            <br>
      There are lots of ways to use oil pastels. In the image of the orange skull to the right you see the use of a chemical 
            solvent that melted the oil pastels down and also assisted them to blend. It is also used to help keep the work 
            more fixed. It is less likely to wear away from the paper and the image won’t be lost with time.

     The great thing about oil pastels is that they can be mixed with any color. Meaning that your work 
             can be more colorful and abstract than when using other mediums. You don’t have to practise
             as much to figure out how to use this medium, you can generally catch the hang of how to use 
             the oil pastels fairly easily as it is just like combining the technique of coloring with pencils 
             and the blending style of paint. As long as you understand the basic principles of art you should 
             be able to easily use oil pastels.
             <br>
    To use them at a higher skill level, is just to be using them as an alternative to using paint. Oil pastels 
             also tend to create a different texture entirely from paint. Like acrylic paints create flat color 
             (which can be blended to make more textured) oil pastels also when used in a certain way and blended
             out entirely make incredibly flat colors, but if you wanted to bring in a different texture maybe one 
             that was more scratchy or rough it is very easy to do, it can be done by not blending the colors so well, 
             or pressing down to create a strong color. There are many ways to use oil pastels, the best way to 
             figure out how you want to use them is by making a small sketch and then coloring it in with your 
             oil pastels, trying as many different techniques as you can to find the one that you like best.

      Art is something that many people think about starting for a fun hobby, many people think that it would be 
             really satisfying to be able to create images that are exact copies of what you see in front of you, 
             or images that are ideas that you wish to materialize using your own hands. But then a lot of us begin 
             this art process and suddenly realize that it is not something that naturally happens. Art skills are 
             things that are worked on and worked on for many years, until the artist finally thinks they are at a 
             skill level that they wished for. Here's the starter tips.
             <br>
      A very important thing to understand before you start art, is composition. I struggled with understanding this
             part of my art. It is a very meticulous skill that can make or break your artwork. Composition is where
             you must think carefully about how your artwork is put together. This can be anything from the color of 
             each part of the piece or the number of details there is to a work. Where each detail is placed and how 
             it should be viewed. The purpose of composition is to help the viewer's eye follow a suggested path 
             through your piece and to ensure the viewer's eyes will naturally flow through the piece. This may not 
             seem very important but it is. If the composition is a jumble with no real direction for your eye to travel 
             to, it will confuse the viewer and give them a strangely uncomfortable feeling. Giving them a path for their
             eyes to follow will help them find the way that they will find the most enjoyable way to view the artwork.

     I would advise if you are just beginning on your art journey you develop your drawing skills first. This is 
            because the skills you develop when drawing are ones that are applicable to all of your styles of art.
            An example of one of these skills is your ability to take in information and then regurgitate it onto
            a piece of paper. You will begin to understand how to use your tools and move your pencil or pen to get 
            a certain line at just the right angle to convey that you are seeing in the most accurate way. When you 
            begin to understand these small mechanics you will find drawing from sight a lot easier and you will be 
            able to draw faster and more accurately. When this becomes easier, you will be able to take these skills
            into your paintings.  
            <br>
    There is one piece of advice I must tell you and it will not be very helpful I am sorry to say. It is that there 
            is no tip nor instructions, that will help you get any better at creating art. You will always need to 
            figure this process out for yourself. Which is why generally creating art is a very personal process, 
            because only you can develop at your own pace. You will understand some things faster than others. 
            <br>
    But overall the best piece of advice I can give you is that if you really want to develop your skills you must be
            persistent. When you are feeling frustrated and like your art is no good you must power through that and 
            continue to find ways of developing. There is nothing wrong with realising you are good at one style of art
            and then focusing on developing that skill solely, this could be painting, drawing, collages, etc. As long 
            as you enjoy creating it that is all that matters because as long as you enjoy creating art you will always 
            develop something. It may not be good but it is yours and it marks a time in your art journey and possibly a 
            time in your life that is possibly important.
