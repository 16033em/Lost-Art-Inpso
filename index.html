       Drawing is the most important thing to understand before you try to understand the other areas of art. It is the easiest way that you can begin
             to understand how to put what you are looking at into lines on a piece of paper. The best way you can develop your skills in the way of drawing. 
             Is by simply drawing one thing again and again and again. There is truly no other way to improve other than practise. Drawing, you don’t have to
             spend a long time on your drawing, the main purpose for you drawing is to help you grow an understanding on viewing and then regurgitating the 
             information you are viewing from looking at the object. My advice to you when beginning to draw start by drawing objects. Try to draw an object 
             with your eyes and your hands. What I am trying to say is that you should try to look at an object and then as you move your hand to draw a 
             certain part of that drawing your eyes should be calculating the length and the angle of said line. This is a very difficult skill to develop
             and the best way to do this is by doing blind drawings, Which are quite frankly infuriating. How you perform a blind drawing is by setting an 
             object in front of you and then drawing that said object without looking at you drawing. You should not take your eyes off the object. You 
             should be constantly studying the object while you are drawing it. You should also not take your pen/pencil off of the paper. A good object
             to use while doing this practise, is your hand. Now something to make clear is that you must come to terms with your art skill, you must 
             focus on not getting frustrated by the outcome of your first drawings, do not give up simply because they do not look like you want them to.

     Painting is where you carry the skills you learnt from drawing in to a new material situation. 
           You need to create a new understanding of how the material can be manipulated. Since you 
           started by learning how to draw the technique and understanding will be there but will just 
           need to be applied in a new way. A way to get introduced into painting is by simply drawing a 
           picture and the painting over that drawing, like coloring in a coloring book. This will help
           you get the understanding on how to manipulate the material. Make sure while you are doing 
           this you are trying lots of different techniques to do so. This could be painting purely
           with colorful paints and staying away from tonal work, or going completely black and white 
           with zero color. Also try out lots of different equipment when painting. The equipment I
           will usually use on one painting is: 2 Paint brushes (1 medium square brush, 1 small pointed 
           brush) the type of brush will depend on the painting. A paint palette, this is just a hard 
           surface that is used solely for your paint. You will mix your paint here and also hold your 
           separate colors here. Sometimes if I feel like it I will use a palette knife. There are loads 
           of ways to use palette knives, just go and watch some of Bob Ross’s videos and you will see that
           you can not only mix your paint using them but you can also use them to create new types of textures 
           and shapes on your painting. And then I will of course use all sorts of colors of paint. A little
           tip for blending paint is dry brushing. This is when you have two colors that you wish to blend, 
           you will take a completely dry and clean brush and then gently drag the two wet colors into each 
           other, remembering to regularly wipe the paint on the brush off.

      When starting out with paint you really should know that there are different types of paint that can be used for different 
             things. I would advise using Acrylic paint to start out with. It  is not only a lot cheaper than other types of paint 
             it is also a good way to start to understand how to paint. Acrylic is a lot smoother and less textured, it's very easy 
             to apply. Its difficulty is that it dries very quickly and depending on the quality of the paint you buy it can be very 
             lacking in pigment. Oil paint is the more commonly well known style of paint, it used by the old masters, such as Leonardo 
             Da Vinci and Rembrandt as well as Vincent Van Gogh. This type of paint dries incredibly slowly meaning it is a lot more 
             movable and blendable but it takes a lot of practise to understand. Oil paint is a lot more stiff and therefore more 
             textured than acrylic paint. I myself have never used oil paint but I have gained a small understanding from talking 
             with more experienced artists around me. Mixing paint is also a skill you will need to practice well. Paint mixing is 
             a must when beginning to paint, it is where you find and create colors that are just right for your purpose, when you 
             practise enough you will be able to create exact matches of colors you see before you on the first try. To do this you 
             will need to understand the color spectrum, and how mixing colors can make other colors and then you will need to start
             practicing yourself. Just find a color in a book, on a wall, on a painting and try mixing that color (Be sure to use the 
             paint afterwards!). The best tip that I recently came to understand is when mixing paint to create depth in a piece you
             need to experiment with tones. Creating tones is not creating a darker version of the color you are trying to make a 
             shadow on, it is about making a dull and grayer version of the color you created. This means you need to add more black 
             to your color, often until the color is pretty much black.

     Water color is often used more often than you would think. It is used very often to create backgrounds, 
              details in the foreground of a piece as well as in the background. It can also be the sole material used in a piece. Watercolor 
              can be used to make complicated pieces of art as well as simple pieces. When water coloring the important thing is to use the white from the paper.
              Which is why it is often quite a difficult skill to master as you will likely need to use large quantities of your color to get the desired effect
              that you are chasing after. But the issue with watercolor, is that since it is a building medium, meaning when you want to color something on the 
              piece you need to use multiple layers of the color or another color to get the desired pigment. This is because water color is such a light medium, 
              it can create incredibly intense and soft images at the same time that no other medium can replicate. But the issue again with this is that once you 
              apply the water color it is almost impossible to remove or make lighter. White in water color doesn’t quite work as a color softener, it works more 
              to change the pigment. This is a skill you can practice on scrap pieces of paper.

      The thing that most artists struggle with when beginning out with water color is how to make the 
            naturally flowing water stay in specific areas unlike the others around it. This is something 
            that again will come naturally to you. It is a slow process but it will come along with your 
            drawing techniques. Because when you begin to understand the way that you can move your arm to 
            create the desired shape that you are observing you will be able to slowly develop your own
            understanding and the making of shape will be something that you will naturally understand how to do and develop.

     This material is a lot of fun to use if you enjoy quite messy mediums. But they are not always needed to be used in a messy way. 
            It is possible to use them in such a way that means that they are quite clean and precise. The best way to use oil pastels
            is to generally mash them into the page so they become almost paste-like meaning that they are lost easier to blend, spread,
            but also cover the set area in a thick way. This means that they will cover the area and then blend. There are lots of ways
            to use oil pastels. In the image of the orange skull to the right you see the use of a chemical solvent that melted the oil
            pastels down and also assisted them to blend. It is also used to keep the work more permanent. It is less likely to wear away 
            from the paper and the image to be lost with time.

      Art is something that many people think about beginning, many people think that it would be really fun to be able to create images
             that are exact copies of what you see in front of you, or images that are ideas that you wish to materialize using your own hands. 
             But then a lot of us begin this art process and suddenly realize that it is not something that naturally happens. Art skills are 
             things that are worked on and worked on for many many years, until the artist finally thinks they are of a grade that they wished 
             for. But still as an artist you will be able.
      A very important thing to understand before you start art, is composition. I struggled with understanding this part of my art. It is a very meticulous 
             skill that can make or break your artwork. Composition is where you must think carefully about how your artwork is put together. This can be 
             anything from the color of each part of the piece or the number of details there is to a piece. Where each detail is placed and how it should
             be viewed. The purpose of composition is to help the viewer's eye follow a suggested path through your piece. The way their eyes will naturally 
             flow through the piece. This may not seem very important but it is. If the composition is a jumble with no real direction for your eye to travel
             to, it will confuse the viewer and give them a strangely uncomfortable feeling. Giving them a path for their eyes to follow will help them 
             find the way that they are going to find the piece a lot more enjoyable to view.

      I would advise if you are just beginning on your art journey you develop your drawing skills first. This is because the skills 
            you develop when drawing, generally regarding your ability to take in information and then regurgitate it onto a piece of 
            paper. Once you begin to understand how to use your tools and move your pencil or pen to get a certain line at just the 
            right angle to convey that you are, for example looking at a table from above. When you begin to understand these small 
            mechanics you will find drawing from sight a lot easier and you will be able to draw faster and more accurately. When this 
            becomes easier, you will be able to take these skills into your paintings.  
      There is one piece of advice I must tell you and it will not be very helpful I am sorry to say. It is that there is no tip nor instructions, 
            that will help you get any better at creating art. You will always need to figure this process out for yourself. Which is why 
            generally creating art is a very personal process, because only you can develop at your own pace. You will understand some things 
            faster than others. But over all the best piece of advice I can give you is that if you really want to develop your skills you must 
            continue to develop your skills. When you are feeling frustrated and like your art is no good you must power through that and continue
            to find ways of developing. There is nothing wrong with realising you are good at one style of art and then focusing on developing 
            that skill solely, this could be painting, drawing, collages, etc. As long as you enjoy creating it that is all that matters because
            as long as you enjoy creating art you will always develop something. It may not be good but it is yours and it marks a time in your
            art journey and possibly a time in your life.
